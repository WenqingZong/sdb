# Simple Debugger

Just to record my progress while reading the book [Building A Debugger](https://nostarch.com/building-a-debugger).

## Project Setup
The book guides us how to build a debugger for `x86` platform and all devices I have are Apple M Series, so use docker
instead.

Tools used:
- VsCode
- DevContainer
